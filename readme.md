# Polymorphism Challenge ðŸŽ­

## Description
This assignment illustrates the concept of **Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Python.  
The program defines a base class `Vehicle` and multiple subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`, `Bicycle`) that each implement the same method `move()`, but with different behaviors.

## Features
- Inheritance: All subclasses inherit from the base class `Vehicle`.
- Polymorphism: The `move()` method is overridden in each subclass to show unique behavior.
- Clean and simple demonstration of OOP principles.

## File
- `polymorphism.py` â†’ Contains the Python code for the activity.

## Example Output
When running the program:
Driving on the road
Flying in the sky
Sailing on the water
Pedaling on the track
